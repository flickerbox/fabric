## How to build the SASS documentation
Our SASS documentation HTML page is generated by using the node package [SASSDOC](http://sassdoc.com/).

To generate the docs 
```
$ npm install 
$ npm run sassdoc
```

To view the generated doc go to ./docs folder and open up the index.html file in a browser.
